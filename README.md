This project focuses on the analysis of sales data using Power BI to derive meaningful insights and support data-driven decision-making.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to analyze sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset. This analysis provides valuable insights into revenue trends, market performance, and profit contributions.

## DAX Formulas

To extract valuable insights from the data, I wrote several DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) formulas. These formulas helped in deriving metrics for the analysis. 

Some of the key metrics calculated include:

- **Profit contribution by market** :  Give the insights of the contribution in profit as per market.
- **Total profit margin** : At what profit margin company sell the products as per market.
- **Last year revenue** : Utilize to compare current year's revenue with last year's revenue.


## Insights and Visualizations

Using the calculated metrics and insights derived from DAX formulas, I created several visualizations and dashboards in Power BI. These visualizations include:

- **Bar chart** : Shows the revenue by market, profit contribution and profit margin
- **Line chart** : Display the revenue trend
- **Slicer** : For operating the dashboard based on the years and months
- **Revenue KPI** : Illustrate the Revenue
- **Line and clustered column chart** : Compare the last year's revenue with current year's

## Conclusion

This project showcases the power of Power BI in data analysis and visualization. By leveraging DAX formulas and creating insightful visualizations, we can gain a deeper understanding of sales performance and make informed business decisions.
